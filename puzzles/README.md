# Puzzles

The puzzles in this directory were downloaded from the [Lichess Open Database](https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles), split into files based on rating, and stripped of unused data.

## Online

Online files contain puzzle id and rating only. The IDs are used to query the [Lichess API](https://lichess.org/api#tag/Puzzles/operation/apiPuzzleId). Deciding which ID to fetch is based on the player's current rating.

## Offline

It is important for this project to support offline puzzles. Only minimal information is stored to keep file size small: puzzle id, fen, moves, rating. As a first "quick and dirty" solution to keeping file sizes small, puzzles were sorted into files in rating intervals of 100. This created files rougly less than 2MB each.

Note that these offline puzzles are designed to be used when fetch requests fail from the Lichess API. This is one of the primary reasons breaking the puzzles up into smaller files.

## Generating Puzzle Files

A simple Python script was used to generate these files from the original Lichess csv file. It is pasted below. Why not upload the file in a .py file? Mostly to not accidentally flag the repository with a python label. Why not use node.js? Because... I said so.

```python
import csv

# Define the rating rounding interval and output file names
rating_interval = 100
output_files = {}
for i in range(1, 31):
    filename = '{}00.csv'.format(i)
    output_files[filename] = ((i - 1) * rating_interval, i * rating_interval - 1)

# Open all the output files and create a CSV writer for each file
writers = {}
for filename in output_files.keys():
    file = open(filename, 'w')
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writers[filename] = (file, writer)

# Loop through each row in the input file
with open('input.csv', 'r') as input_file:
    reader = csv.reader(input_file)

    for row in reader:
        rating = int(row[3])
        rating_range = None

        # Determine which output file to write to based on the rating
        for filename, (min_rating, max_rating) in output_files.items():
            if rating >= min_rating and rating <= max_rating:
                rating_range = (min_rating, max_rating)
                break

        # Write the selected columns to the output file
        if rating_range:
            filename = '{}00.csv'.format(int(rating_range[0] / rating_interval) + 1)
            writers[filename][1].writerow([row[0], row[3]])

# Close all the output files
for file, writer in writers.values():
    file.close()

```

## Future

There are many other ways to optimize these files, but this is a quick and simple way to get it done. If file size becomes an issue, some form of compression would really improve things.
